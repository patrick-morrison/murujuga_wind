# Murujuga Weather Analysis Shiny App

This is an R Shiny app to analyse the Bureau of Meteorology data for Murujuga. We are looking at the synoptic patterns that lead to northerly winds, and the rain.
This shows a graph of wind and rain, and allows the user to click on it to show synoptic chart and satellite.
